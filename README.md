For my CE218 Game Programming Module, my Main assignment was to create a Space themed Games

The game I have created is similar to the classic Space Invaders. It has been modernized with new enemies, better graphics and improved game mechanics. An example is having power ups where the player can pick up battery packs that allow the user to shoot more than 1 projectile at a time up to 3 projectiles at a time. 

The game can be run by loading the java files and resource files into IntelliJ and running the program through IntelliJ, or by building a JAR file with the CE218_Game_Programming_Assignment.java file and inputting it into a folder with the relevant resource files.
